###Next step to modification of TILGAN code###
1.Change the encoder backbone to a BERT pretrained model
2.Change the decoder backbone to a GPT pretrained model

###What to do inorder to implement them###
Revise the "Seq2Seq" class in the "models.py" file. Note that only one submodule should be modified in each progressive step, which enhances ablation analysis.
In specific, should separately revise two new versions of file:
File 1 only substitutes the encoder and File 2 only substitutes the decoder. After each file is tested for viability, combine their respective revisions and commit the final version.


###Debugging issue###
1.The input indices to BERT is of wrong dimensionality. Expected dim = 2, input din = 3 with the last dim of length 1. Need to reduce the last dim.
